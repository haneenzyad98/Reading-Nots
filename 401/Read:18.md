# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

-  serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose.

Over half of the internet’s traffic is served by a content delivery network (CDN). The goal of the CDN is to reduce latency – the delay between submitting a request for a web page and the web page fully loading on your device – by reducing the physical distance that the request has to travel.

##  Cloud Storage


Cloud storage allows you to save data and files in an off-site location that you access either through the public internet or a dedicated private network connection. 

## Amazon API Gateway

 is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.


## DynamoDB

is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

- reliable performance even as it scales;
- a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
- a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.


## DynamoDB is a particularly good fit for the following use cases:

- Applications with large amounts of data and strict latency requirements.

- Serverless applications using AWS Lambda.

- Data sets with simple, known access patterns.
