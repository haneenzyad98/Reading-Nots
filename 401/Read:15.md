# Trees

A tree is a representation of the non-linear data structure. A tree can be shown using different user-defined or primitive types of data. We can use arrays, and classes connected lists or other kinds of data structures to implement the tree. It is a group of interrelated nodes.

- Trees are one of the most fundamental data structures. They are used to store and organize data. A binary tree is a tree data structure composed of nodes, each of which has at most, two children, referred to as left and right nodes. The tree starts off with a single node known as the root.

-  Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

  -   Depth First

prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.



  - Breadth First

Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.
