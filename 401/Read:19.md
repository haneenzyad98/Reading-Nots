## Dynamo vs Mongo

- DynamoDB: In DynamoDB, you can create and use a so-called secondary index for similar purposes as in RDBMS. When you create a secondary index, you must specify its key attributes and after you create it, you can query it or scan it as you would a table. DynamoDB does not have a query optimizer, so a secondary index is only used when querying or scanning.

- MongoDB: Indexes are preferred in MongoDB. If an index is missing, every document within the collection must be searched to select the documents requested by the query. This can slow down read times.
