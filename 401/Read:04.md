## Data Modeling

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. First, the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.


- Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development:

      - You receive fast feedback.
      - You spend less time in the debugger.
      - You are able to identify the errors and problems quickly.

- Disadvantages of TDD :

      - slow process 
      - Tests got to be maintained when requirements change
      - No silver bullet 


- What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

      The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.
      

- functional programming  

      unctional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”. It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value whereas a statement is executed to assign variables.

- object-oriented programming (OOP)

         object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.      


- class

         Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.         


- super
      
      The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.   

      When used in a constructor, the super keyword appears alone and must be used before the this keyword is used. The super keyword can also be used to call functions on a parent object.
