# Access Control (ACL)

An ACL is a list of permissions that are associated with a directory or file. It defines which users are allowed to access a particular directory or file. An access control entry in the ACL defines the permissions for a user or a group of users. An ACL usually consists of multiple entries.

-  basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent  to provide a user name and password when making a request. 

- bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. ... The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources


- JSON Web Token is a standard used to create access tokens for an application. It works this way: the server generates a token that certifies the user identity, and sends it to the client.
