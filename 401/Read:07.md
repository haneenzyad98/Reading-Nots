- What can you do with an authorization code?

to giving someone the ability to access a resource.

authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular.


- access token

access token contains the security credentials for a login session and identifies the user, the user's groups, the user's privileges, and, in some cases, a particular application.



- Client ID

 Client ID represents a unique browser/device and is created and assigned by Universal Analytics cookie _ga. Client ID is assigned to each unique user of your website.


- Client Secret 

 This is the true secret key, which is stored on server side securely & not available to public.

 - Authentication Endpoint

 - What is JWT ?  (JSON Web Token)

  is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

  - Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.
