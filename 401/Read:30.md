# Application State with Redux


redux allows you to manage your app's state in a single place and keep changes in your app more predictable and traceable. It makes it easier to reason about changes occurring in your app


Redux provides a solid, stable, and mature solution to managing state in your React application. Through a handful of small, useful patterns, Redux can transform your application from a total mess of confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern JavaScript powerhouse.

The principles of Redux aren't new, but they are packaged and presented for you in an easy to use a library that not only elevates your applications but also improves your general understanding of building JavaScript UIs.
