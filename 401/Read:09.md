# OAuth

open Authorization:

OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. 

- The simplest example of OAuth in action is one website saying “hey, do you want to log into our website with other website’s login?” In this scenario, the only thing the first website – let’s refer to that website as the consumer – wants to know is that the user is the same user on both websites and has logged in successfully to the service provider – which is the site the user initially logged into, not the consumer.


- How OAuth Works

Step 1 – The User Shows Intent.

Step 2 – The Consumer Gets Permission.

Step 3 – The User Is Redirected to the Service Provider.

Step 4 – The User Gives Permission.

Step 5 – The Consumer Obtains an Access Token.

Step 6 – The Consumer Accesses the Protected Resource.
