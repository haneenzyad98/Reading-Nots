# Stacks and Queues

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

- Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.

- Stacks follow these concepts:

  FILO
First In Last Out

  LIFO
Last In First Out

# What is a Queue


queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data.
