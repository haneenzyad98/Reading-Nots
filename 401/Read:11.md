#  Event Driven Applications

Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision.

# EventEmitter

Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away. Of course, creating our own version of EventEmitter wouldn’t be much of a challange, and in fact there are several modules published on npm such as EventEmitter2 and EventEmitter3 which promise a faster performance than the native EventEmitter.

         const EventEmitter = require('events').        EventEmitter;
         const myEventEmitter = new EventEmitter;


- Why is access control important?

Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems.

- Role Based Access Control?
role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security paradigm whereby users are granted access to resources based on their role in the company. RBAC, if implemented correctly, can be an effective way of enforcing the principle of least privilege.٢



- What is a role used for?
A user role defines permissions for users to perform a group of tasks.
