# Introduction
- HTML
- Css

All websites use HTML and CSS, but content
management systems, blogging software, and
e-commerce platforms often add a few more
technologies into the mix.

When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

## Structure
The structure is very similar
when a news story is viewed
online (although it may also
feature audio or video). This is illustrated on the right with a copy of a newspaper alongside the corresponding article on its website.
