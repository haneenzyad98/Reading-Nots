Headings

HTML has six "levels" of
headings:

<h1>  h1 is used for main headings
<h2>  h2 is used for subheadings
If there are further sections
under the subheadings then the
<h3>h3  element is used, and so
on.

______________________________________________

<p> *p* To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening <p.>
tag and closing </p.> tag.

____________________________________________
<b>
By enclosing words in the tags
<b.> and </b.> we can make
characters appear bold.</b>

_____________________________________________


<br/.>
As you have already seen, the
browser will automatically show
each new paragraph or heading
on a new line. But if you wanted
to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can
use the line break tag <br/.>

Semantic Markup :e some text elements that are not intended to affect the
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the
pages â€” they are known as semantic markup.

# Introducing CSS

CSS allows you to create rules that control the
way that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.
