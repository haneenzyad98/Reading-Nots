# Comparison 

1. == mean is  equal to 

2. != mean is not  equal to

3. === strict equl to used to compres two value to check that both the data type and value are the same 

4. !== strict not equl to used to compres two value to check that both the data type and value are  not the same

5. ( >) greater than to checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right

6. < to checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right

7. (>=) greater than to checks if the number on the left is greater or equal  than the number on the right

8. <=  greater than to checks if the number on the left is less or equal  than the number on the right

# logical operators
most return single values of true or false 
example : ((5<2)&&(2>=3))
muste return false

- && mean AND 
T && T = T
T && F = F
F && T = F
F && F = F

- || mean OR 
T || T = T
T || F = T
F || T = T
F || F = F

- ! mean NOT 
!(TRUE) false
! (3<2) True



# Loops
check a condition if returns true a code bloke will run .then the condition will be checked again and if still returns true the code bloke will run again until the condition return false.

types of loops:
 - for  it is run until the condition return false

 - while it is run until the condition return true

 - do while it will always run the statement inside the curly braces at least once even if condition evaluates false

for (var i=0;i<3,i++){
    document.write(i);
}


while (i < 10) {
msg += i + ' x 5 = ' + (i * 5) + '<br I>';
i
